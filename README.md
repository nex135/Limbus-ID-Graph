# Limbus-ID-Graph


Exists [here](https://nex135.github.io/Limbus-ID-Graph/)

Heavily based on null-machine's [limbus-company-roll-analyzer](https://github.com/null-machine/limbus-company-roll-analyzer)

Adverse and Prime need to be changed, Expected charts may include conditionals.

TODO: Check all previous IDs for errors. Add search bar for IDs. Rename IDs to their proper name. Add SP slider to replace current fixed SP values. Add input for SP values. Update old conditionals (Some expected culprits include older Ishmael IDs, Heathcliff IDs, Charge IDs). Update the info dump to be more useful. Possibly update charts so they are more intuitive at first glance.

Specific TODO: Change Rabbit expected. Update Rosespanner Rodion S2. Hardcode Devy Sinc S3 prime state.
